To work properly, this application need 5 arguments. These arguments are -a1, -a2, -d, -u and -p or --api1, --api2, --url,
--user and --pass, api1 is the url base of the old api, api2 is the base url of the new api, url is the database where
we are going to save the data, this parameter is need to modify the UUID, user is the user of the database and pass is the password.
If you are doubting about what parameters you can use, you can use -H or --help to receive the list of
parameters that u can use. but -a1, -a2, -d, -u and -p are mandatory.<br><br>
While the application is running this one will ask you to introduce 2 paths, the first one is the path where the files
and folders are saved in the old version. the second one is the path tha you are going to use to save the folder and
documents, there's no need to have this place created, if exist the application save the location, else will be created.
After move and update the documents and folders you can choose to erase the old folder path, choose wisely, this action
is permanent.<br><br>
After this you are finnish
