# Migrate

To work properly, this aplication need 2 arguments. This arguments are -a1 and -a2 or --api1 and --api2, api1 is the url base of the old api, and api2 is the base url
of the new api. If you are doubting about what parameters you can use, you can use -H or --help to receive the list of parameters that u can use. but -a1
and -a2 are mandatory.<br><br>
While the aplication is running this one will ask you to introduce 2 paths, the first one is the path where the files and folders are saved in the old version. the second one is the path tha you are gonna use to save the folder and documents, there's no need to have this place created, if exist the aplication save the location, else will be created.
After move and update the documents and folders you can choose to erase the old folder path, choose wisely, this action is permanent.<br><br>
After this u are finnish
