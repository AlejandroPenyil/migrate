# Migrate

To work properly, this aplication need 2 arguments. This arguments are -a1 and -a2 or --api1 and --api2, api1 is the url base of the old api, and api2 is the base url
of the new api. If you are doubting about what parameters you can use, you can use -H or --help to receive the list of parameters that u can use. but -a1
and -a2 are mandatory.
